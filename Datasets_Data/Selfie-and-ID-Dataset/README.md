# About the dataset
We introduce a large image dataset called Selfie and ID Dataset for training a neural network to solve reidentification tasks. The dataset consists of selfie photos and personal document photos of people. The list of documents, from which photos are taken: passports, foreign passports, driving licenses, medical certificates, membership/bank/transport cards, certificates, diplomas, etc. 

"Selfie and ID Dataset" can be utilized in several applications, including facial recognition algorithms, identity verification systems, forensic analysis, and deep learning research. By providing both personal and official photographs, this dataset offers a comprehensive resource for evaluating and improving the performance of algorithms in various real-world scenarios.

The dataset consists of **5,591** sets of images (**83,865** images in total) from **4,200+** unique people from **55** countries. The data for the dataset is still gathering, so the number of photos is getting bigger!

### The dataset includes 2 different types of images:
- **Selfies** - 13 selfies of a person from a mobile phone, the person is depicted alone on it, the face is clearly visible.
- **ID Photos** - ID photos of the person from 2 different documents.

### Data in the dataset
- People from 18 to 76 years old are presented in the dataset.
- For each person in the dataset age, country and gender is presented.
- The data was mostly collected indoor, however there are also selfies made outdoors.
- The lighting is artificial, natural daily lightning, evening outdoor lighting and dark indoor lighting.
- People provided selfies where the head takes up at least 1/2 of the frame.
- Distance from the camera is approximately 20-30 centimeters.
