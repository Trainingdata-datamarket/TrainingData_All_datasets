# About the dataset

**Data generation** in machine learning involves creating or manipulating data to train and evaluate machine learning models. The purpose of data generation is to provide diverse and representative examples that cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the model's *robustness and generalization*.

The dataset contains **GENERATED Vietnamese passports**, which are replicas of official passports but with randomly generated details, such as *name, date of birth etc*. The primary intention of generating these fake passports is to demonstrate the structure and content of a typical passport document and to train the neural network to identify this type of document.

Generated passports can assist in conducting research without accessing or compromising real user data that is often sensitive and subject to privacy regulations. Synthetic data generation allows researchers to *develop and refine models using simulated passport data without risking privacy leaks*.

### The dataset is solely for informational or educational purposes and should not be used for any fraudulent or deceptive activities.

### Data in the dataset
- Images are generated on the basis of official passports.
- Name, sex, place of birth, date of birth and other personal information is randomly generated.
- Photos of people are taken from the website https://this-person-does-not-exist.com/en.
- People from different age groups, genders and ethnicities are presented in the dataset.
- Passports are captured in different angles, with various contrast and noise settings.
