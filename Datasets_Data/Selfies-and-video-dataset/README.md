# About the dataset
We introduce a large image dataset "Selfies and Video" for training a neural network to repel various attacks on biometric access systems. The dataset consists of a collection of selfies and videos recorded by individuals using both their front and web cameras. The main focus of the videos is on people pronouncing numbers in the wide range of individuals from various backgrounds and demographics.

"Selfies and Video Dataset" solves re-identification tasks and could be utilized in the field of facial recognition technology, for emotion detection and sentiment analysis applications, the dataset could also find application in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies. Overall, the dataset offers a wide range of applications in computer vision, artificial intelligence, social analysis, and human-computer interaction domains.

The dataset consists of **4,052** sets videos and selfies (**32,416** media in total) from **3,500+** unique people from **15** countries. The data for the dataset is still gathering, so the number of videos and photos is getting bigger!

### The dataset includes 4 different types of media files:
- **Smartphone selfie** - a selfie of a person made with a mobile phone, the person is depicted alone on it, the face is clearly visible.
- **Smartphone video** - filmed on the front camera, video of a person pronouncing numbers: duration of the first video is 30 seconds, duration of the second video is 8 seconds
- **Webcam selfie** - a selfie of a person made with a webcam, the person is depicted alone on it, the face is clearly visible.
- **Webcam video** - filmed on the webcam, video of a person pronouncing numbers: duration of the first video is 30 seconds, duration of the second video is 8 seconds

### Data in the dataset
- 4 video files and 4 images made with phone front camera (2 videos and 2 photos) and web camera (2 videos and 2 photos).
- On video people pronounce numbers in Russian.
- People from 18 to 70 years old are presented in the dataset.
- For each person in the dataset age, country and gender is presented.
- The data was mostly collected indoor, however there are also selfies and videos made outdoors.
- The lighting is artificial, natural daily lightning, evening outdoor lighting and dark indoor lighting.
- People provided selfies and videos of themselves where the head takes up at least 1/2 of the frame.
- Distance from the camera is approximately 20-30 centimeters.
